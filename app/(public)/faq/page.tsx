	// General FAQs
	{
		question: `What is ${company.name}'s primary business model?`,
		answer: "We are a certified corporate financial services agency. We provide certified mutual fund distribution advising and licensed IRDAI insurance consultancy. Our focus is on long-term client relationships rather than quick commission sales.",
		category: "general",
	},
	{
		question: `Where is ${company.name} registered and regulated?`,
		answer: "We are an AMFI Registered Mutual Fund Distributor, and our Managing Director is an LIC MDRT (USA) Member since 2007, a Chairman's Club Member, and a Star Health Elite Advisor.",
		category: "general",
	},
	// Mutual Funds FAQs
	{
		question: "What is a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)?",
		answer: "A SIP is a method of investing a fixed sum regularly (monthly or quarterly) into selected mutual fund schemes. It facilitates disciplined savings, utilizes rupee-cost averaging, and reduces the risk of timing the market.",
		category: "mutual-funds",
	},
	{
		question: "How do I choose between Equity and Debt funds?",
		answer: "Equity funds invest in corporate shares, offering higher returns but carry higher short-term risk. Debt funds invest in treasury bills and government bonds, offering steady, lower-risk returns. Our advisors will audit your age, goals, and risk profile to outline appropriate investment splits.",
		category: "mutual-funds",
	},
	// LIC FAQs
	{
		question: "What is LIC term insurance?",
		answer: "Term insurance is a pure protection policy that pays a guaranteed sum assured to your nominees in the event of death during the policy term. It has no maturity or survival benefit, allowing you to secure massive covers for very low monthly premiums.",
		category: "lic",
	},
	{
		question: "How long does it take for LIC claims to settle?",
		answer: `Once nominees submit death certificates and policy certificates, LIC claims are processed quickly. ${company.name} maintains a dedicated offline claims assistance desk that handholds nominees during documentation and bank transfers.`,
		category: "lic",
	},
	// Health FAQs
	{
		question: "What is cashless hospitalization cover?",
		answer: "Cashless cover allows you to get treated at network hospitals without paying admission deposits or medical bills upfront. The hospital bill is settled directly by the insurer. You only pay for non-medical expenses like registration or food.",
		category: "health",
	},
	{
		question: "What is the waiting period for pre-existing diseases?",
		answer: "Pre-existing diseases (like thyroid, diabetes, or asthma) are covered under retail health insurance after a continuous policy renewal period of 3 years (reduced from 4 years under latest IRDAI rules).",
		category: "health",
	},
	// Vehicle FAQs
	{
		question: "What is Zero Depreciation car insurance?",
		answer: "Zero Depreciation is an add-on cover. In standard comprehensive policies, insurers deduct depreciation on rubber, glass, and metal parts during claims. A Zero-Dep cover pays the full replacement value without deductions, minimizing your out-of-pocket costs.",
		category: "vehicle",
	},
	// General FAQs
	{
		question: "What is commercial general liability?",
		answer: "It protects business owners from financial damages arising out of third-party bodily injuries, property damage, or operational accidents occurring on business premises.",
		category: "general-insurance",
	},
	// Billing
	{
		question: `Can I pay premiums through the ${company.name} portal?`,
		answer: "Yes. Our client portal allows you to secure direct payment links to LIC, Star Health, and other insurers. All receipts are archived in your Documents tab automatically.",
		category: "billing",
	},
